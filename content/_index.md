# The boyhood home of Harper and Dylan Reed

#### By @harper and @dylanreed

In the summer of 2016, my brother, Dylan Reed, and I were trying to figure out what the "next" prank would be after [we wrapped our parents car with a zebra pattern](http://zebraprank.com). We wanted to make sure that it was a really great prank and something that was more permanent. 

At the time I was traveling to London a lot and always liked seeing the blue historical markers on every other building around London. We thought maybe that would be a funny thing to add to our parents house: **A historical monument**

The issue was: What would the monument say? 

Well, we figured the best thing to celebrate was our amazing life and our "boyhood home".

Here is the monument:

It is really awesome and helps identify what an important place our parents house is. 

The full text reads: Boyhood home of Harper and Dylan Reed. The first Astronauts to explore Uranus. 

A couple notes: 

* There is a typo
* The rock weighs about 800lbs
* The plaque is supposed to last around 60 years
* We really should double check our work before we set it in stone. so to speak. 
* We are geniuses


## Thanks to:

* Our **wonderful parents** for not killing us, again.
* Our **wonderful partners (Sarah and Hiromi)** for not ratting us out and dealing with the crazy REED boys, again.
* Carmen over at [123-awards](123-awards.com) for making the ridiculous plaque
* [Greeley Monument Works](http://greeleymonumentworks.com/) for doing an amazing job finding a rock and mounting our plaque.
